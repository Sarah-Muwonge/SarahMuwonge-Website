        The graduate study that I am pursuing is in medicine, and I hope to eventually go to
medical school in pursuit of this. My strengths in preparing for graduate study include my strong 
background in biology. I have an Associate in Science (AS) degree for Biology from College of 
the Canyons. As a transfer student, I have been a part of many STEM clubs both here at UC 
Riverside and the community college, College of the Canyons, I had previously attended before 
transferring. I had also attended the community college Los Angeles Pierce College part time 
while I was in high school where I took a couple of humanities courses. Other strengths in my 
preparation for graduate study are taking and doing well in many humanities and social science 
courses which have helped balance out all the science and math courses I have done while also 
helping me to be a more well-rounded individual. There have been some challenges in my 
preparation for graduate study. Like many community colleges, the one I had attended was 
limited in funding and resources, so not many research and lab opportunities were available for 
those of us majoring in the sciences. The pandemic exacerbated this issue by initially causing a 
lot more programs and opportunities to be shut down and unavailable due to everyone trying to 
figure out new methods of doing things and ways to do them while keeping participants 
protected from getting covid. The challenges this pandemic brought forth also influenced how 
well I have done academically. The adjustment to a primarily online environment was abrupt 
and had affected my academic performance, but I persisted and have done my best to improve
and do better in this new academic environment. Despite this, I had done my best to take 
advantage of all the opportunities that were available at my community college. During my time 
at College of the Canyons, I was a member of many STEM centered organizations on campus 
such as the Chemistry club, Math club, and Biology club. I had also been a member of the 
American Student Association, or AMSA, while I attended community college. I had been a 
member of the College of the Canyons AMSA chapter throughout my time attending this
community college, and transferring, I quickly joined UC Riversideâ€™s chapter of AMSA. In 
addition, I have also been a member of AMSA National starting from my time in community 
college and continuing to present day. As part of my continued preparation for my aspiring
graduate study in medicine, in addition to joining UC Riversideâ€™s AMSA chapter, I have also 
joined UC Riversideâ€™s American Medical Womenâ€™s Association, or AMWA, along with joining 
the STEM Connections program.

        My reasons for wanting to undertake graduate studies at the doctoral level include my 
desire to eventually attend medical school to become a medical doctor. As a biology major, I am 
very interested in the study of biology and how medical science ties into the biological sciences. 
My career objectives include working in a lab and doing research using the Bachelor of Science
degree in Biology I am currently in the midst of obtaining. I then hope to use this background 
and knowledge in my further studies at the doctoral level.
